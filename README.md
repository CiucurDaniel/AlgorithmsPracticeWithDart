# Algorithms Practice With Dart

On this repository I do various coding problems in order to stay trained with my coding and problem-solving skills.

# How to run

Inside of `bin/` folder there is a separate folder for each problem which contains two things:

* a README to describe the problem
* the dart file containing the solution

Each of those dart files has a main function there form where you can run the program.
